I’m Alessandro — a freshman Computer Science student based in the United States.

I love programming and building anything I can imagine. If I decide to make something, I’ll find a way to get it done.

My main tech stacks include Python, C, Lua, and I primarily work in PyCharm and VS Code. My favorite tools are my whiteboard and my laptop.

I'm currently working on a game project and constantly exploring new ideas.

**Fun Facts:**
• I play football  
• I hate apples  
• I love penguins  

**Hobbies:** gym, football, problem solving
